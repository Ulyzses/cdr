        <h2 class="header">Computerised Data Registry</h2>
        <p class="content">Computerised Data Registry is a custom-made website designed to allow score updates between teachers and students. It acts as a link between the two such that as soon as teachers finish checking activities, they may upload the scores on the site and students will be able to see their scores in real time, provided that they have access to the internet. It is provided as an alternative to manually distributing checked activities which is sometimes only done when nearing the end of a grading period.
